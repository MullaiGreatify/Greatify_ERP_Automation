<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository contains a Student Information System project and libraries that demonstrate how to create a Student Profile and verify the details across all dashboards. The project is implemented using a BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) framework with Cucumber (v7.15.0) and Java. Page Object Manager and the singleton concept are utilized to enhance code reusability.

Key Features:
- Programming Language: Java (v21.0.1)
- BDD Framework: Cucumber (v7.15.0)
- Project Management Tool: Maven (v4.0.0)
- Selenium Drivers: Web Driver Manager (v5.6.2)
- Design Pattern: Page Object Manager with Singleton Concept
- Reporters: Extent Report, Cucumber Reporting, HTML Report
- CSV Integration: Opencsv (v5.7.1)
- Mail Integration: The project leverages Javax.mail to send generated reports to specified recipients.
- Error Handling: Captures error screenshots for failed test cases.

### Installation & Prerequisites

1. JDK 1.8+ (Ensure that the Java class path is properly set)
2. Eclipse IDE
3. Required Eclipse Plugins:
   - Maven
   - Cucumber
4. Browser driver (Ensure that you have the appropriate browser driver for your desired browser and that the class path is correctly configured)

## Framework Setup

To set up the framework, you can either fork or clone the repository from [here](), or download the ZIP file and set it up in your local workspace.

## Basic Usage

- ### Configuration
  The project uses a [*config.properties*](./src/test/resources/config.properties) file to manage global configurations such as browser type and base url.
  
- ### Test Data
  The project uses *csv* file to store test data. *CSVReader* used to retrieve the data.
  Student document path need to mention in the csv file.

## Reports

Once you have run your tests, you can generate various types of reports. This `selenium-cucumber-java` framework utilizes different test reporters to communicate pass/failure information.

## Reporting

### HTML Report

To generate an HTML report, use the following command: `mvn test -Dcucumber.options="--plugin html:target/result.html"`. 
This command generates an HTML report, and you can find it at `target/result.html`.

### Extent Spark Reports

The framework utilizes the [Spark Reports Framework](http://www.extentreports.com/docs/versions/4/java/spark-reporter.html) to generate HTML test reports. Here is an example of a report generated by the Extent Reports open-source library:

## BDD Automation with Cucumber-Java and Page Objects

In this repository, we encourage the use of Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Cucumber and Java to develop automation scripts. We provide predefined Step Definitions packaged under `/steps/Commonsteps.java` to help you accelerate your automation development. These Step Definitions support commonly used helper methods and can be customized according to your needs.

## The Page Object Design Pattern

To better organize your test code and make it more maintainable, we recommend using the Page Object Design Pattern. With this pattern, the UI elements of your web application are modeled as objects within the test code. This approach reduces code duplication and allows easy updates if the UI changes. Writing and maintaining test automation can be challenging, especially when it comes to keeping selectors (classes, IDs, or XPath, etc.) up to date with the latest code changes. The Page Object pattern provides a solution by centralizing these selectors in separate <pagename>.java files, where you can manage them along with the associated methods.

By using the Page Object pattern, your test files will only call the test methods, while the selectors and reusable methods reside in the corresponding Page Objects. This approach helps maintain a separation of concerns and ensures that when a test fails, it fails on an individual step. If a selector becomes invalid, updating it in the Page Object file can fix multiple failing tests that rely on the same selector.

Implementing the Page Object pattern promotes maintainable and scalable test automation code, making it easier to adapt to UI changes and keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
